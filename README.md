dt "dart template" creates a simple template with the given path+namne,
the path is relative to the "lib" directory  // pages\newpage  creates the file at currentdir\lib\pages\Newpage.dart,
being in a subdirectory of lib when running the command also works such as C:\Users\yourUser\Projects\projectname\lib\pages and just the name will give the same result
